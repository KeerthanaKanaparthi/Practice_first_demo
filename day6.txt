Problem Statement: (Application to make use of Static,nonStatic ,Constructors)
-> Assume that as a developer you need develop an application for an ABC bank to provide bank account for their customers.
-> Each account should have the details like: actno,holdername,amount,ageof/holder,rateofintrest,bankname,accountStatus.

-16>age<25::2 percent ROi
-25<age>50 ::3 percent roi
-Age>50:: 4 percent Roi
